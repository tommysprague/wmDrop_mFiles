__Correction__

In September 2020, Author TCS discovered a small analysis issue involving the script wmDrop_vectorMean_rotateCoreg1_CR.m This issue resulted in Figure 6C, S6, and S7 being plotted using data from n = 3 subjects (rather than n = 6), along with statistics corresponding to these figures. When this was corrected, no results substantially changed. Only this script and this analysis was impacted.

In the course of testing the code author TCS additionally made some small edits for clarity to other scripts, along with adding a script which was missing from the initial repository (wmDrop_fitRecons_exactCoreg_byRecallError1_CR.m)

The authors are in the process of issuing a formal correction, and apologize for the inconvenience.
